My name is Oriol Mirosa. I am the Chief Data Scientist at [Shubh Loans](https://www.shubhloans.com/), an Indian startup based in Bangalore that uses alternative sources of data to provide access to credit to those previously unserved.

Before that, I was a professor of sociology and global studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where I taught a number of classes and I did research on the environment and on access to water for vulnerable groups in developing countries (you can find more details about my work and a list of my publications in my [sociology website](http://oriolmirosa.com/)).

I'm originally from Catalonia, but I live in Atlanta with my wife and daughter.

These are some of the technologies I use in my work:

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Bokeh, PyTorch)
- R
- Jupyter Notebook and Lab
- Javascript (React & Redux)
- D3
- HTML & CSS

You can check out some of my work in the [Portfolio](/portfolio/) page of this website, and you will find all my open source code in my [Github page](https://github.com/oriolmirosa/).
