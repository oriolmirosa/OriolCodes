My name is Oriol Mirosa. Until recently, I was a professor of sociology and global studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where I taught a number of classes and I did research on the environment and on access to water for vulnerable groups in developing countries (you can find more details about my work and a list of my publications in my [sociology website](http://www.mirosa.org/)).

I have recently moved to Atlanta to get married to my wonderful fianc√© and pursue a new career following my passion for data science and programming. Here is a list of some of the technologies I use:

- R
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Bokeh)
- Javascript
- D3
- HTML & CSS
- React & Redux

You can check out some of my work in the [Portfolio](/portfolio/) page of this website, and you will find all my code in my [Github page](https://github.com/oriolmirosa/).
